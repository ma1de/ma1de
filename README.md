# Hello 👋
I'm a Java developer who's currently learning Kotlin and C.<br>
I have 3 years of experience in Java and I'm 16 years old.<br>
I live in Russia, but I hope that I can move out of here as soon as I get a job so I can live a better life without corruption.<br>
I speak Russian and English and I've been learning English since I was 9 years old.<br>
